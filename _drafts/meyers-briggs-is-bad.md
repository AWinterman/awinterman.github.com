# What's the Matter with Personality Tests?

- they are bullshit
  - deterministic process, 
    - attribute set A implies personality type B, when in actuallity personality is complex, ever-changing, and subtle.
    - they can't tell you anything you don't put into them because of their deterministic mapping process.
    - it's hard to imagine how they might conceivable tell you more, because they lack human intuition
  - reductionist view of personhood
    - some models of personality have scientific verification of their validity and repeatability (e.g. [big 5](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-accurate-are-personality-tests/)) but most do not (Meyers-Briggs)
- Despite this they are marketed as helping you make decisions based on a "true you" that you somehow lack access to.
- Decisions made based on personality test results MAY be good ones, or they may be destructive
    - employers use them
        - this is bad
        - make recommendations for hiring/promotions
        - make all the managers take them.
            - establishes shared language for talking about needs/styles of communication
            - this is good!
            - however it can also give people reason to disregard/ignore others.
                - hidden brain episode where one person was given a personality test that caused his coworkers to stop trusting his ability to be organized/rationally problems solve.
            - story of merger where ceo of new parent company fired everyone who did not match his personality type.
- people are malleable
    - people respond to self conceptions of themselves
    - chose to or not to pursue career paths, options, based on their self-perception.
    - given that we had better be damn careful about what we choose to tell people about  themselves, and honest and critical of our ability to tell them anything accurately.
    - it's important that we treat others with decency and as full people. A personality test is an invitation to put other people in a box and then treat them like their box rather than a full person.
    - "I said hello to the woman sitting next to me. Her name tag said "Laurie — ENFJ."
        Laurie checked me out and sighed, relieved. "We're both E's," she said. "We'll get along great." - http://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history
    - "Across all languages and continents, however, the first rule of speaking type remains the same. You do not, under any circumstances, refer to MBTI as a "test." It is a "self-reporting instrument" or, more succinctly, an "indicator." "People use the word 'test' all the time," Barb complains. "But what you're taking is an indicator. It's indicating based on what you told the test." "- http://digg.com/2015/myers-briggs-secret-history
- the terms itself implies a world view and understanding of what it means to be a person, and of individual's behavior
- often encode more of the worldview of the author than anything else (e.g. dichotomous nature of the meyers-briggs scores, you are an I or an E, etc.)

- it's kind of a pyramid scheme:
> Each test costs $49.95 per person, more if you want a full breakdown of your type, and even more if you want an MBTI-certified consultant to debrief your type with you. No one questions the sheer ingenuity of this sales scheme. We are paying $1,695 to attend a course that authorizes us to recruit others to buy a product — a product which tells us nothing more than what we already know about ourselves. 

> [Briggs Meyers second novel] Give Me Death is more explicitly about the preservation of the family, but saddled with a far more sinister understanding of type: Type as racially determined. There is talk of eugenics. There is much hand wringing about the preservation of Southern family dynasties, about "honor" and "esteem." That the novel was written in the years when laws forbidding interracial marriage were increasingly the target of ACLU and NAACP protests makes it all the more reactionary, and thus all the more unsuitable, from an image management perspective, for reissue today. One would hardly enjoy "typing" these characters.

> The second rule of speaking type is: Personality is an innate characteristic, something fixed since birth and immutable, like eye color or right-handedness. "You have to buy into the idea that type never changes," Barb says, speaking slowly and emphasizing each word so that we may remember and repeat this mantra — "Type Never Changes" — to our future clients. "We will brand this into your brain," she vows. "The theory behind the instrument supports the fact that you are born with a four letter preference. If you hear someone say, 'My type changed,' they are not correct." 

> the indicator imagine that each person will fall into their designated niche in a high-functioning and productive social order. This is another fiction — to my mind, a dystopian fiction — that most personality tests trade in: The fantasy of rational organization, and, in particular, the rational organization of labor. "The MBTI will put your personality to work!" promises a career assessment flier from Arizona State University, a promise that is echoed by thousands of leadership guides, self-help books, LinkedIn profiles, and job listings, the promise that underwrites such darkly futuristic films as Divergent or Blade Runner. To live under an economic system that is not organized by personality, thinks the heroine of Divergent, is "not just to live in poverty and discomfort; it is to live divorced from society, separated from the most important thing in life: community."

> Or as a trainee belts out in the middle of an exercise, "Team work makes the dream work!"


> Type shaming is a common complaint amongst the trainees. "Learning my type was mortifying,”" one woman confesses. "My boss outed me as an introvert and a feeler on a team of extraverts and thinkers. People freaked out." Barb soothes her, but ultimately, encourages us not to dwell on the abuses of type. CAPT, we are told, bears no responsibility for unethical uses of the indicator. Once it is let loose on the world, what people do with it is their business.

> Was Isabel a casual racist or a mere cultural observer, unwittingly invoking the language of her time to debate issues of identity? Are these two ways of thinking and talking about race even separable from one another? It is hard to answer these questions based solely on her letters to Hay. But Whether decidedly inferior or not, for Isabel, the "colored woman" was not a person but a lesser projection of the white office worker's psyche. In a long letter to Hay, Isabel criticized the office worker's "fervent insistence upon the symbolically true proposition" that "everybody is equal, of equal value, with equal prospects for development." Symbolically, all men may have been created equal. In reality, equality seemed an impossible aspiration for a personality test that was constructed in 1947.

> "Quite a few questions prove to be effective for only one sex," she wrote to Hay when she presented him with two separate scoring keys for the indicator — the standard key and a "female key," weighted to account for their innate vulnerability to feeling. Later versions of the questionnaire would provide distinct breakdowns of personality profiles, one "Valid for Men," the other "Valid for Women." Unsurprising, then, that women were more often type-suited to the caring professions, as nurses, teachers, and secretaries, rather than executives and managers. Destiny wasn't biological; it was typological.

> Is the test a joke? A scam? Every six months or so a reputable news source publishes what it takes to be a devastating critique of the type indicator. Consider such recent titles as "The Mysterious Popularity of the Meaningless Myers-Briggs, Nothing Personal: The Questionable Myers-Briggs Test, and Goodbye to MBTI, the Fad That Won't Die. The skeptics who write these pieces tend to repeat the same arguments. They say the instrument is unreliable, that people often get different results when they take it from one week to the next. They say the type descriptions are loose and baggy enough to fit anyone, a flagrant example of circus man P.T. Barnum's observation that the best hoaxes are the ones that have "got something for everybody." They deride the test's origins as the hobby of two untrained women, even though they seem to have only the faintest sense for what its history really is. 

- we need a language for the language we use to talk about how we like to talk. We need a term for "this is my style of communication, please be understanding that it might be different from yours"

>  More times than I care to count, one of my fellow trainees begins a sentence by disavowing her ability to do something because of her type. "I'm an N, so I just can't see the details," one woman says matter-of-factly to me, as we complete an exercise in which we have 30 seconds to list everything we see in a kitschy painting that Barb has projected onto the screen. This strikes me as a sad capitulation to a reality that isn't real at all.

> "When I murder someone," she would joke to her boss, "I'm just going to say, 'Well, what did you expect? I'm an ISFP!'"
