title: Linear Algebra for Computerists
----

<div id=Intro>
Brief introduction to linear algebra for computer people.
</div>

<div id="Why">
Linear Algebra is a [stupidly
useful](http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/256682/why-study-linear-algebra) field to know about.

- Applications in every science
- Statistics (and machine learning)
- Engineering
- CSS Transformations
</div>

<div id="ItsTaught">
It is taught As a second or third year undergraduate math course. There is
mathematics here:

- A vector space is defined over the reals
- Axioms are laid out
- Advanced results (svd, spectral theorem, properties of determinants, projections) are found.
- Machinery is built up, but linear algebra calculations are tedious and error
  prone. 
- Computers are good at them!
</div>

<div id=Library>
Let's build a linear algebra library!
</div>

<div id=Caveat>
Our lib. may or may not be the best solution for data
analysis/applications. The point is clarity rather than speed.

Searching npm for "linear algebra" yields a surprising number of results.
</div>

<div id=Vector>
The first thing we need is a vector:

{% highlight javascript %}
{% endhighlight %}

</div>
