Ok, I lied. This is actually written the day after the next post, not the day before. But I feel the need to innagurate the blog, and my book review, however proud of it I may be, is not really the best peice with which to do this. So here we are. Eventually, this will be a poem (short) about the nature of perception, and a caravaggio painting, I have a particular one in mind, an angel swoops over a man shrouded in darkness. 

Ah...

Or maybe I'll use this one instead.
