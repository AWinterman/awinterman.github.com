subtitle: Eventually there will be an appropriate poem here

Ok, I lied. This is actually written the day after the next post, not the day before. But I feel the need to innagurate the blog, and my book review, however proud of it I may be, is not really the best peice with which to do this. So here we are. Eventually, this will be a poem (short) about the nature of perception, and a caravaggio painting.

The difficult thing about including Caravaggios on webpages is context. These paintings are massive. Some of them fill walls in Cathedrals-- there are little vestibules eighteen feet high with a caravaggio on each side. Dim summer light filters in through the dorway, more light comes from prayer candles, and what one imagines are electric simalcrums of oil burning lamps. The painting itself is light with strong, fixed position lighting which exagerates the lights and the darks. These truely are small islands of humanity in a world lit only by fire. Light, so important in Caravaggio, to the photographer who captured for us, and to the reproduction of the image on your screen.

On the internet, this context is lost, and a new context is added: The camera-man's artifice. The machine before you. I give it context myself-- the color scheme of the website, the positioning of the image. I force you to scroll around it ino order to see the whole thing. 

All these change your perspecive. I do not apologize. The painting is still beautiful. And the calling remains. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=08e9k-c91E8&feature=related">"Sing, Oh Muse, of the Wrath of Achilles!"</a>
