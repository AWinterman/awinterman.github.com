title: What's the Matter with Personality Tests?
subtitle: Personality tests are not an appropriate tool for resolving workplace conflict.
---

I was recently asked to take an enneagram at work. I refused, because I have
never liked or trusted personality tests, but my manager asserts that my
refusal is a red flag for them. They have scheduled group time to talk about
the enneagram results, and are unwilling to discuss a contingency in which any
group member does not take it. I think this is completely unnacceptable. While
a test may provide a framework for better understanding interaction,
personality tests run the risks of telling incorrect, limiting, or even
derogatory stories. A worker forced to take the test must either internalize
the test results, finding accomodation with its assertions about them, or
challenge the test itself.

If they chose to reject the test, they also challenge the social capital of both the
test administrator and whoever ordered the test (likely their manager), and
accept the loss of the money and time they paid to take the test. If they choose
to accept the test, they must do the emotional labor of integrating what the
test says about them with their personal narrative, and deal with coworkers and
higher ups reinforcing that narrative as the rejecter wrestles with it
themselves.

If a worker choses not to take the test, they are putting themselves in
opposition to people who likely have power over their economic survival. As a
white-presenting and masculine-presenting software engineer, I have outsized
economic power-- I am hard to replace, and it's easy for me to find other work.
Because of this priveledge, and my Jewish tradition which enjoinders that I
consider *myself* the oppressed, I actually have an obligation to fight this
managerial overreach into worker's psychological health. 

# Personality Is Personal

Some people like these tests. They say they encoding real knowledge in an
interactive format that feels like a journey of self discovery. If you find it
useful, that's great. However part of the reason you can do so is because you
buy in, at least partially, to their model of personality as a series of traits
which can help you predict human behavior. 

There are other scientific models, some of which are ["behaviorally based
approaches [that] define personality through learning and
habits,"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personality#cite_note-Handbook-1).
There are cultural and religious models of personality as well. Jewish
tradition says that the person is created in the image of a single deity that
is everywhere, all powerful, of which all the universe is an expression.
Further, the person is an embodiment of that infinite divinity. A staunch
believer might regard the assertion that there are nine types of humans as
blasphemous. God after all, is one and infinite, so so must personality. It
feels obvious to say it, but a worker's interpretation of personality is highly
personal, and tied into cultural and religious factors that they should not be
required to bring to the workplace.

The enneagram asserts that it can help us understand aspects of ourselves which
we did not already know, or could not already explain to a coworker, given
adequate time and intention. This is hogwash because of the very nature of the
test-- a worker answer a series of questions. The enneagram uses some
deterministic series of steps to interpret those questions into a "personality."
It can't possible have additional information, so *at best* tells a worker
exactly what they put into it. If it's proponents purport it does more, either
they are lying, or it must make leaps to judgements that cannot be justified and
which we have no reason to believe.

## A Physical Parallel

There are recent, debunked historical parallels to personality testing. A
popular podcast, 99% Invisible, recently covered the application of the
mathematical mean to populations of people in an episode titled [On
Average](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/on-average/). It traced the
evolution of the average summary statistic from it's origins in astronomical
measurement, to social sciences, and eventually the military. At one point
military equipment was all made to the average sized person.  Uncomfortable
enough when you're talking about boots, shirts, and pants, but actually
dangerous when the same principle is applied to aircraft cockpits, where
shorter-than-average workers might be literally unable to reach the
average-person-positioned controls. **On Average** concludes with the account of
the invention of the adjustable cockpit, and sums up nicely:

> Today, we take for granted that equipment should fit a wide range of body
> sizes rather than being standardized around the “average person.” From this
> understanding has come the science of ergonomics: the study of how to match
> people’s physical capacity to the needs of the job.
>
> Whether it’s the equipment, or the whole work environment, design must
> accommodate more people who are outside the average &hellip; because in
> reality no one is actually average.

Yes, most trait-based models of personality have more than one axis, but I hope
the parallel is clear. The built environment is an edifice of our understanding
of people, and the way they use that environment. The failure of early cockpit
designers was to mistake the power of the statistic. They trusted the mean over
their own perceptions (obviously there are small and large people, whose
differing geometries will affect their ability to operate a specific machine).
Instead of their own human understanding, they relied on faith in a technical
mechanic whose inner workings they did not fully understand.

## Expectations Matter

Like the built environment, personality is an edifice. It is constructed of
foundational stories, skills we have developed for navigating complex social
situations, and genetic make up. Likewise, our understanding of others is an
edifice, constructed of our experience with them, and of others. We have deep
intuitions about individuals which encode enormous complexity. Humans have
developed tools for dealing with this sort of complexity. We tell stories.

We tell stories about what characterizes a bad person, and what happens when
they come into power. We tell stories about ourselves. We tell stories about
where we came from.  Mine involve generations of cultural persecution, which was
attended by stories, others tolds about my culture: Jews are good with money
(nevermind that banking was one of few paths to prosperity available to Jews),
intelligent, avaricious, argumentative, vulgar, and loud. My grandparents are
holocaust survivors, traumatized by adherants to a genocidal philosophy of
personhood that replaced the individual with the race and then ascribed to the
race characteristics which must be evaluated before permitting the survival *of
my grandparents*.

The Nazis had a trait based model of personality. Allow me to draw some
parallels to the enneagram:

  - I have no control over the it
  - The creators encode their bias into its construction
  - Others will build a model of me based on the trait based model of
    personality it produces.
  - Others will act on the judgements that result from that model.

I am emphatically **not** saying that the enneagram is Nazi, but it certainly is
not safe.

## Primum non nocere 

The enneagram is an enormously more complicated method than race or gender for
replacing people with their stereotypes. When I have brought this up to
proponents, they have attempted to ameliorate my concerns by talking about the
complexity of the system-- you can draw attributes from other types, you can
move from type to type, but that does not address the systemic criticisms I
raise:

- Reducing people to their types is inherently dangerous, especially to people
  who face systematic oppression
- Any personality test encodes a particular philosophy of personality which is at complete odds with my own.
- Forcing your employees to take a personality test requires emotional labor
employers have no right to ask of their employees, since it is completely
unrelated to accomplishing the tasks agreed upon for their employment.
- It takes control over a worker's personal inner narrative. 

There is no oath of management, but managers could do worse than starting with
Hipocrates's: "First, Do No Harm." Forcing your employees to take a personality
test, even one with scientific backing, fails Hipocrates oath.
