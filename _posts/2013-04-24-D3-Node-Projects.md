If you're wondering what I've been up to lately, well, I've started at [Urban
Airship](http://urbanairship.com/) as a Javascript developer. One of the cool
things about my new place of work is how strongly they encourage writing
open-source-able projects, and then making them publicly availble when their
ready. As a result, I've already published my
[first](https://npmjs.org/package/d3-mapping)
[two](https://npmjs.org/package/d3-link-register) node modules on npm!

I even took some time over the weekend and made the source for my
[d3-mapping module literate](http://awinterman.github.io/d3-mapping/docs/Mapping.html).

So that's what I've been up to these past couple of weeks.
