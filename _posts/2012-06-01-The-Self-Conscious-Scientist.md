title: The Self Conscious Data Scientist 
---

Data Scientist is an interesting title. It sounds post-modern: What is the science of data? Data is produced from observation, the tool of the scientist. So in a way data science sounds like the science of science, or perhaps simply the science of working with these new corporate scientists (GOOG, FB, everybody else who has ever set up a logger), and the unprecedented quantities of observation they produce. 

From my perspective the job requires a mix of data management and interpretation. A company hires a data scientist to keep track of data in a reasonable way (do we set up a database? How about a data store? Do we even need such complicated things, or will our nix's native directory structure suffice?), and to interpret and analyze that data. Working at Periscopic, a small design firm, my job is a lot of the former, and a little bit of the latter. I spend probably three times as much time reformatting data,  making it machine readable, and thinking about the best way to keep track of it as I do interpreting it or prototyping methods for visualization. 


All facets are important, but it is surprising to see how much the prototyping stage can influence the final result. The way I choose to display this information really frames the future conversations we have about the project. This process itself is interesting. We do almost no statistics (we do occasionaly use kernel density estimation to construct nicely curving summaries of the results.
