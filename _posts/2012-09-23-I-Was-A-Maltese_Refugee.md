title: Refugees in Malta
subtitle: All grouped up with no place to go.

I just read an article in a print version of the New York Times (available
[here](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/world/europe/malta-struggles-under-wave-of-african-migrants.html?ref=world))
describing the plight of African immigrants in the small archipelago nation of
the Republic of Malta. Malta is small and dense. It has a population 368,000
people, according to its [Wikipedia
article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta), who squeeze into its 316 square
kilometers at a rate of 1,306 people per square kilometer, making Malta the
seventh densest nation in the world. After all the unrest in Northern Africa
over the last few months, the Maltese have been flooded with immigrants bound
for the wealth and stability of Europe. Many of immigrants are rescued off of
makeshift crafts, starving, thirsty, dirty and poor.

<div class="poem">
	Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
	With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
	Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
	A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
	Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
	Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
	Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
	The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
	"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
	With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
	Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
	The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
	Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
	I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
	-- <em> The New Collosus ,</em> by Emma Lazarus

The Times article described how poorly the Maltese are dealing with this
influx: First they jail them for six months to a year, often in makeshift
prisons made from unconverted aircraft hangars. Then they end up in "open
centers," little more than collections of cargo cannisters with communal taps
and bathrooms for sanitation. The Times interviewed one plaintive young man:
"We are here, looking for a life."

The Times spent a lot of ink describing the how limited the Maltese
government's resources for deportation and relocation are. They lack embassy
contacts with African countries. Other European nations won't take them. The
Maltese are stuck in a sticky situation with no options which are both moral and
political feasable.

Paint me liberal, but I think the Maltese have been presented with an
unheralded opportunity which, to hear the Times tell it, no one is
acknowledging. Immigrants are motivated by the promise of a better life for
themselves and their families. If given the opportunity they will work hard
for success. Immigrants are *not* the deadbeats of a nation. They 
 had the motivation,  means, and  wherewithall to evaluate their
situation and leave it for the unknown. They fled corruption or violence.  They
tore their roots out of tougher earth. They are, in a sense, the select of
Northern Africa, and even better, they are heavily invested in making a
new life for themselves wherever they end up. They certainly don't want to go
back where they came from, so they have no options but to languish or to work
hard for their success. They are more thankful for opportunities than most, and
harder working than the natives who never had to fight for the societal
benefits they enjoy. I think there is a strong argument to be made that
open immigration policies and the resulting concoction of viewpoints, success
strategies, and cultural cross-currents are part of what made the United States
such an economic power house. 

So why aren't the Maltese embracing this glut of human capital? Where are the
entrepreneurs opening up factories with all this cheap and eager labor? From
the Times article, it sounds like the problem is nativist sentiment among the
natives, a veiled form of discrimination which hampers economic development and
drives people to ignore opportunities. Maybe cleverer heads will prevail,
before the windfall turns sour, angry, and destructive.
