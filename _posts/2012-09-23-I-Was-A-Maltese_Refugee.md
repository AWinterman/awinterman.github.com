title: Refugees in Malta
subtitle: All grouped up with no place to go.

 I just read an article in a print version of the New York Times (available
 [here](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/world/europe/malta-struggles-under-wave-of-african-migrants.html?ref=world))
 describing the plight of African immigrants in the small archipelago nation
 of the Republic of Malta,  eighty kilometers off the coast of
 Sicily. Malta is small and dense, a population 368,000 people, according to its
 [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta), who squeeze
 1,306 people per square kilometer. Malta is the seventh
 densest nation in the world. After all the unrest in Northern Africa over the
last few months, the Maltese have been flooded with immigrants bound for the
wealth and stability of Europe. Many of immigrants are rescued off of makeshift
crafts, starving, thirsty, dirty and poor.

<div class="poem">
	Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,
	With conquering limbs astride from land to land;
	Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand
	A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame
	Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name
	Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand
	Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command
	The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.
	"Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she
	With silent lips. "Give me your tired, your poor,
	Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,
	The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.
	Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,
	I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"
	-- <em> The New Collosus ,</em> by Emma Lazarus

The Times article described how poorly the Maltese are dealing with this
influx: First they jail them for six months to a year, often in makeshift
spaces like unconverted aircraft hangars until they can figure out who they are
and how old they are. Then they end up in "open centers," little more than
collections of cargo cannisters with communal taps and bathrooms for
sanitation. The times interviewed one plaintive young man: "We are here, looking
for a life."

Paint me liberal, but this looks like an unheralded opportunity for the nation
of Malta to me. These people are desperate, motivated by the promise of a
better life for themselves and their families. If given the opportunity they
will work hard for success. Immigrants are *not* the deadbeats of a nation.
They are the ones who had the motivation and the means to make a better
situation for themselves. They fled corruption or violence and tore out their
roots. These are hard things to do, and they succeeded. These immigrants are
the select of Northern Africa, and even better, they have quite a bit invested
in making it in wherever they end up. I think there is a strong argument to be
made that open immigration policies and the resulting concoction of viewpoints
and strategies are part of what made the United States such an economic power
house. 

So why aren't the Maltese embracing this glut of human capital? Where are the
entrepreneurs opening up factories with all this cheap and eager labor? From
the Times article, it sounds like the problem is nativist sentiment among the
natives, a veiled form of discrimination which hampers economic development and
drives people to ignore opportunities.
